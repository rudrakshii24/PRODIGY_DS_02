Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a popular choice for practicing data cleaning and EDA. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Data Acquisition:

We'll be using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. You can download it directly from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic.

2. Data Cleaning:

Missing Values: Check for missing values in each column. You can handle them by removing rows with missing values (if the percentage is low) or imputing them with appropriate strategies (e.g., mean/median for numerical data, mode for categorical data).
Inconsistencies: Identify and address inconsistencies in data format (e.g., date formats, capitalization).
Outliers: Explore potential outliers in numerical variables. Decide if they are genuine data points or errors. You might winsorize (cap) outliers or address them based on domain knowledge.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the Data:
Get basic information about the dataset - number of rows, columns, data types.
Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical variables.
Use frequency tables or value counts for categorical variables.
Data Visualization:
Create histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variables like Age, Fare.
Create bar charts or pie charts to explore categorical variables like Passenger Class, Embarked port.
Create scatter plots to explore relationships between variables. For example, plot Age vs. Fare to see if there's a correlation between age and ticket price.
4.  Relationships and Patterns:

Analyze how survival rate varies across Passenger Class, Sex, Age, and Embarked port.
Identify correlations between numerical variables using correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson correlation).
Look for patterns in categorical variables. For instance, did a higher percentage of women and children survive compared to men?
5.  Documenting the Process:

Keep track of the cleaning steps taken and the reasoning behind them.
Note down any interesting observations or patterns identified during EDA.
Tools and Techniques:

Programming languages like Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are commonly used for data cleaning and visualization.
Spreadsheet software like Excel can also be used for basic EDA.
Remember, EDA is an iterative process. You might revisit cleaning steps or explore new relationships based on initial findings.

This is a basic framework for performing data cleaning and EDA on the Titanic dataset. You can delve deeper by:

Investigating feature engineering - creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve analysis.
Grouping and aggregating data - calculating statistics for groups of data points (e.g., average survival rate by Passenger Class).
Using more advanced visualization techniques like boxplots or violin plots to compare distributions.
By following these steps and exploring further, you can gain valuable insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic.
